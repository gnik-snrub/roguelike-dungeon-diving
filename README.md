# Automatic-funicular

My attempt at following the guide on creating a Roguelike game in Rust featured here

https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/index.html

## Addition features that I'd like to implement include:

- ✓ Tweak the world gen to make it more interesting than just rectangles.
- ✓ Add in secret passages
- ✓ Connect dead-end hallways to other rooms.
- ✓ Possibly add in a random monster generator.
- ✓ Create more color variance in the world tiles.
- x Add in some sort of scoring system (Track deepest crawl / fastest crawl / most kills / etc...)
- x Give the player character the ability to steal, and upgrade the powers of monster he slays.
