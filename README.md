# Roguelike Dungeon Diving

My attempt at following the guide on creating a Roguelike game in Rust featured here

https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/index.html

## Addition features that I'd like to implement include:

- ✓ Tweak the world gen to make it more interesting than just rectangles.
- ✓ Add in secret passages
- ✓ Connect dead-end hallways to other rooms.
- ✓ Possibly add in a random monster generator.
- ✓ Create more color variance in the world tiles.
- x Add in some sort of scoring system (Track deepest crawl / fastest crawl / most kills / etc...)
- x Give the player character the ability to steal, and upgrade the powers of monster he slays.

## Controls:
- Num1 <-> Num9: Movement + attacking
- "g": Grab an item
- "i": Inventory
- "c": Charater stats
- "d": Drop an item
- "<": Descend stairs
- Mouse: View entity names + spell targeting.
